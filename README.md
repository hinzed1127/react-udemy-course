#Modern React with Redux
A companion repo as I go through Stephen Grider's Udemy course, [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview).

This course covers a lot of concepts/technologies, including:
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - For managing state
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - For writing ES6 and maintaining browser compatibility
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Module bundling and more
* The core concepts to successfully implement UIs with React
